# B.TECH-FSP COMPUTER LAB CLASS-PROTEUS SIMULATION PROJECTS
 It Contains All the Program Done in FSP Classes using Proteus 8 professional by me in my FSP Computer Lab Class.
 This repository contains simulation projects developed using Proteus 8 Professional as part of my BTECH FSP Computer Lab coursework.
 These simulations are ideal for understanding the basics of embedded systems and microcontroller interfacing.
 
 Purpose:- These projects were designed to build foundational knowledge in hardware simulation, microcontroller interfacing, and electronic component behavior, preparing for more complex embedded system design tasks.
